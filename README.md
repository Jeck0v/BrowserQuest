## Teams:

Maxime Bidan - Louis Dondey - Arnaud Fischer - Alexis Gontier

## Changes

- Updated backend and frontend to use latest Socket.io and NodeJS version
- Fixed bugs and error.

## HOW TO RUN?

```shell
npm install
node server/js/main.js
```

Then go inside the Client folder and open index.html.

You might want to host a webserver and open index.html in that (e.g. 127.0.0.1/index.html).

Also read the original README files you'll find inside the Client and Server folders to learn the basics of configuring (it's preconfigured right now).

## Original README

BrowserQuest is a HTML5/JavaScript multiplayer game experiment.

## Documentation

Documentation is located in client and server directories.
